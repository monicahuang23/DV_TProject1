We then took the data from SQL and put them into dataframes in R using this code below:\n```{r, tidy=TRUE}\nsource(\"../01 Data/Final Grades.R\",echo = TRUE)\n```\n\n##**Part 3 Creating the plots in Tableau**\nUsing Tableau, we extracted the data from Oracle and created three different types of plots for our dataset. \n\nThe first plot we created was a scatter plot. \n",
